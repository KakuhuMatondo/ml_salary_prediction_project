**ML Salary Prediction Project**

**Overview:**
This project aims to predict salaries based on various factors using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the 2023 stackoverflow developers dataset containing information such as years of experience, education level, job title, and location to build predictive models. The models can assist both job seekers and employers in negotiating fair compensation packages.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://survey.stackoverflow.co/]. It comprises a comprehensive collection of features relevant to salary prediction, including:
- Years of experience
- Education level
- Job title
- Location
- Industry
- And more

**Approach:**
The project follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing relationships between variables, identifying trends, and gaining insights into the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize performance.
7. **Deployment**: Deploying the best-performing model for real-world use.

**Usage:**
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KakuhuMatondo/ml_salary_prediction_project.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks sequentially
